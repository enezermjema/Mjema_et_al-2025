# Climate leaves molecular signatures of adaptation in native _Arabidopsis thaliana_

## Abstract

Climate change poses a major threat to humanity by driving biodiversity loss and reducing crop yields1,2. To understand the molecular and developmental impacts of rising temperatures, plant science has relied heavily on the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana. Despite decades of research, its development under fully natural conditions remains poorly understood, and only ~30% of genes have experimental functional annotations, largely because many functions are subtle or manifest only under specific ecological contexts3. Here, we address this gap with an ecological genomics approach that integrates intensive phenotyping and transcriptomic profiling of naturally occurring plants in their native habitats. Across two environmentally distinct locations and five growth seasons (2021â€“2025), we captured detailed traits from more than 3,000 Arabidopsis plants and 1,300 corresponding transcriptomes, spanning a wide range of interannual temperature variation. This dataset of over 35,000 quantitative phenotypic measurements provides an unprecedented resource for linking climate fluctuations to plant traits and gene expression. Seasons with pronounced temperature anomalies directly influenced phenotypes, and climatic parameters together explained up to 17% of trait variation. In situ transcriptomes carried clear temperature signatures, which we exploited with machine learning to identify genes underlying climate-relevant traits. The models recovered canonical temperature-response regulators, including PIF44,5, ELF46, and the ethylene receptor ETR17, and uncovered previously unrecognized genes with potential roles in climate adaptation. This ecological genomics framework establishes a scalable model for climate-aware functional genomics in plants.
